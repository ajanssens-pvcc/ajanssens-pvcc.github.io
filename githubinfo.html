    <h1>All About Github</h1>
    <p>Q:What is a version control system?</p>
    <p>A: It is the a system responsible for tracking and managing changes to software code</p>
    <p>Q:What is a git?</p>
    <p>A:distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.</p>
<p>Q:What is Github?</p>
<p>A:It is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.</p>
<p>Q:What is the difference between Github and Git</p>
<p>A:Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.</p>
<p>Q:Who started Github and how was it started?</p>
<p>A:The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon. Wanstrath and Preston-Werner needed GitHub for their own work, and so they developed their tool out of necessity. The two men quickly identified a major problem in their work—forking code branches and collaborating on programming projects—and devised a solution that met their needs</p>
<p>Q:What company owns it now?</p>
<p>A:Microsoft</p>
<p>Q:How much does a Github account cost?</p>
<p>A:It is free.</p>

<p>A:GitHub's mascot, which is an anthropomorphized "octocat" with five octopus-like arms.</p>
<p>Git/Github terms:</p>
<ul>
    <p><li>Repository - A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history </li></p>
    <p><li>Commit - an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when.</li></p>
    <p><li>Fork - A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository.</li></p>
    <p><li>Push - To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</li></p>
    <p><li>Pull Requests - Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.</li></p>
    <p><li>Workflows - A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs </li></p>
    <p><li>Issues - Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion thread. You can also categorize an issue with labels and assign it to someone. </li></p>
    <p><li>Raw Button - you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling. </li></p>
    <p><li>Blame button - The "blame" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.</li></p>
